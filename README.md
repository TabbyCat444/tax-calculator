# tax-calculator

A tax calculator I wrote for my own convenience at work as an electronics retail associate to handle the ever present "Can you tell me how much all this will cost after tax?" question from customers.

At this current point in time this tax-calculator is specific to the state and local taxes of Texarkana, TX. It includes pronmpts for mobile devices, which have an extra tax here, and regular items which are only subject to state tax.

Feel free to use the code as a template for your own city, state.
